## Components

1. **Virtualization Management**: Handles the setup and control of virtual machines.
2. **Network Isolation and Configuration**: Sets up and manages network isolation.
3. **Logging and Monitoring**: Captures system and network activities.
4. **Static and Dynamic Analysis**: Integrates tools for analyzing malware.
5. **Automation and Orchestration**: Automates the workflow of loading, running, and analyzing malware samples.
6. **Reporting**: Generates and displays analysis reports.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/)
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)
- [Sysinternals Suite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite)
- [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/)
- [PEiD](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/PEiD)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kalicode22/MalwareAnalysisSandbox.git
    cd MalwareAnalysisSandbox
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install required Python packages:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Set up the environment**:
    - Configure and start virtual machines.
    - Ensure network isolation.

2. **Run the main script**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. **Analyze Malware Samples**:
    - The automation manager will handle the loading, running, and analysis of malware samples.
    - Logs and network captures will be recorded.

4. **Generate Reports**:
    - The reporting manager will generate and display analysis reports.

## Modules

### `main.py`
The entry point of the application that initializes all managers and orchestrates the workflow.

### `virtualization.py`
Manages virtual machines, including setup, start, and stop functions.

### `network.py`
Handles network isolation and configuration.

### `logging_monitoring.py`
Manages system and network logging using tools like Process Monitor and Wireshark.

### `static_analysis.py`
Integrates static analysis tools such as PEiD and Ghidra for examining malware without execution.

### `dynamic_analysis.py`
Integrates dynamic analysis tools for executing and observing malware behavior in a controlled environment.

### `automation.py`
Automates the end-to-end process of loading, running, and analyzing malware samples.

### `reporting.py`
Generates and stores analysis reports in a SQLite database and provides a simple interface for viewing them.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

Ensure you have the right permissions and follow legal guidelines when analyzing malware. Always run malware samples in a controlled and isolated environment to prevent accidental spread.
